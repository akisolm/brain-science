An Interactive data visualization of the convergence of brain science.  

The project based on d3.js aims to show how to define a generalizable framework for convergence in scientific research, 655,386 publications from brain science as an example and then the status and impact of brain science convergence, whether convergence is evenly distributed across HBS subdomains and whether convergence is evenly distributed over time and geographic region.  

The figure modules are named Defination, Development, Distribution and Diversity, so this is also a *d4* project.
